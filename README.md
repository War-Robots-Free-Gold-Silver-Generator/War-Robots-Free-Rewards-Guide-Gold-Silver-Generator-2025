*War Robots* continues to be a favorite multiplayer mech combat game for players worldwide, offering high-octane battles and extensive customization options. A big part of progressing in the game involves earning in-game currencies like gold and silver. In this 2025 guide, we’ll explore the best legitimate ways to earn free gold and silver in *War Robots* to upgrade your arsenal and dominate the battlefield.

### What Are Gold and Silver in War Robots?
Gold and silver are the primary in-game currencies. Silver is commonly used for upgrading weapons, robots, and modules, while gold is a premium currency required for purchasing advanced gear, legendary pilots, and unlocking certain features. Maximizing these resources is key to becoming a top-tier pilot.

### How to Earn Free Gold in War Robots
Here are some reliable methods to earn gold in 2025 without resorting to cheats or hacks:

1. **Daily Quests and Challenges**  
   *War Robots* offers daily quests that reward you with gold upon completion. These tasks can range from dealing a certain amount of damage to winning matches or capturing beacons. Regularly completing these quests is one of the easiest ways to earn gold.

2. **Event Rewards**  
   Pixonic, the developer of *War Robots*, frequently hosts in-game events. These events often provide opportunities to earn gold by completing event-specific missions or reaching milestones. Keep an eye out for special events, especially around holidays or game anniversaries.

3. **League Promotions**  
   Advancing through leagues by improving your ranking in battles can also earn you gold. The higher the league, the better the rewards, so focus on improving your skills and teamwork to climb the ranks.

4. **Opening Black Market Chests**  
   The Black Market offers various chests that can be opened using keys. Some chests contain gold as part of their rewards. Participate in battles to earn keys and try your luck at earning gold in the Black Market.

5. **Watching Ads**  
   Although it’s a slower method, *War Robots* allows you to watch advertisements to earn small amounts of gold. This is a quick and free option for players who don’t mind spending a few extra minutes.

### How to Earn Free Silver in War Robots
Silver is easier to obtain than gold but equally crucial for upgrading your robots and weapons. Here’s how to maximize your silver earnings:

1. **Engage in Battles**  
   The more battles you participate in, the more silver you earn. Performing well in matches—such as dealing high damage, capturing beacons, and supporting your team—will increase your earnings.

2. **Sell Unused Gear**  
   If you have extra weapons or robots you no longer use, consider selling them for silver. This can provide a quick boost to your silver reserves.

3. **Daily Rewards and Supply Drops**  
   Log in daily to claim your rewards, including silver. Additionally, supply drops become available every few hours and often include silver.

4. **Clan Participation**  
   Joining an active clan can provide additional rewards, including silver, through clan tasks and achievements. Collaborate with your teammates to complete objectives and share in the rewards.

### Avoid Hacks and Cheats
While searching for “gold and silver generators,” you might come across websites or tools claiming to offer unlimited resources. Avoid these at all costs! They are often scams designed to steal your account information or install malicious software on your device. Always play fair to maintain the integrity of the game and protect your account.

### Final Thoughts
Earning gold and silver in *War Robots* may take time and effort, but the journey is rewarding and fair when you stick to legitimate methods. By completing daily quests, participating in events, and improving your skills in battles, you’ll steadily accumulate the resources needed to upgrade your robots and dominate the battlefield.

Gear up, pilot, and let the battles begin!
